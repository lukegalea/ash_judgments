# Validate the agent-facing markdown (AGENTS.md) and the moduledocs by
# building the docs with EXTRA_DOCS=AGENTS.md, the ex_doc#2272 pattern (see
# docs/ in mix.exs). Every warning ex_doc prints fails the run, with one
# exception:
#
#   "references file X but it does not exist" when X does exist in the
#   repository. ex_doc can only resolve links to pages it renders, so a link
#   from AGENTS.md to deps/ash_agent_tools/usage-rules.md always warns even
#   though the file is there. If X exists relative to the referencing file or
#   to the repository root, the link is fine and the warning is dropped. A
#   link to a file that exists nowhere is a real broken link and still fails.
#
# Entries in scripts/extra-docs.baseline ("MESSAGE<TAB>PATH", # comments
# allowed) excuse warnings in generated files we must not edit; a baseline
# line that no longer matches also fails, so the baseline cannot outlive the
# warning it excuses.
#
# Usage: scripts/extra-docs.sh [LOGFILE]
#        With LOGFILE, check a captured `mix docs` log instead of building.
#
# ex_doc is `only: :dev`, so the build runs under MIX_ENV=dev.
